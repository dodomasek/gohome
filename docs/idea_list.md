A list of features we would like to add to goHOME

  - Custom Graphical Control - allows users to upload images and drag/drop widgets to control their home. This would be great for custom apps
  
  - Event Logging in the UI - it would be nice to show the event logs in the UI, so that users don't have to ssh into their PI or computer to debug issues
  
  - Support for webcams
  
  - Support for door locks
  
  - Hide features in the UI
  
  - More advanced automation scripting, complex conditionals
  
  - Re-ordering of features in the UI
  
  - Areas? Allow users to group features by area e.g. kitchen, dining room
  
  - Notifications - hook in SMS and other notification platforms to get notifications of events in your home
  
  - Event UI - page where you can see all of the events in your house in some kind of time chart
  
  - Multiple users
  
  - http2 support
  
  - Better scene creation UI, allow wildcards e.g. all lights.

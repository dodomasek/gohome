A Zone is a controllable output. For example a zone could be a piece of wire with several bulbs attached to it, or it could be a shade, or an outlet. It's something that you can control.  In the case of lights, generally a Zone will be the wire with light attached to it that then connects to a switch or dimmer.

##Types
Currently there are several types of Zones:
 - Light
 - Shade
 - Outlet

The type lets the UI know what controls to show for a particular Zone.  

##Outputs
Along with the Type a Zone has an Output value which can be:
 - Continuous: Something that can be set between 0 and 100 e.g. a dimmable bulb
 - Binary: Something that can be set on or off e.g. an outlet
 - RGB: A Zone that doesn't have just one value, but can display different colors e.g. Flux WIFI bulb
